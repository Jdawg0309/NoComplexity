import pygame

class Ghost:
    def __init__(self, game, name):
        self.screen = game.screen
        self.settings = game.settings
        self.name = name
        self.image = pygame.image.load(f'assets/{name}.png')
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()

    def update(self):
        # Update ghost movement here
        pass

    def draw(self):
        self.screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)
```

This setup provides a basic structure for a Pac-Man game, with placeholders for assets and further logic to be implemented as needed.
